## README: AWS Bedrock Python Samples and Use Cases  

### Overview  

This repository contains Python-based sample projects and use cases that demonstrate the capabilities of **AWS Bedrock**. Bedrock provides access to a range of foundational models, including **Amazon Titan**, **Nova**, **Claude** (Anthropic), **Llama** (Meta), and more, enabling developers to integrate advanced AI into their applications.  

The repository showcases:  
- **Bedrock Agents**: Building intelligent task automation using Bedrock Agents.  
- **Action Groups**: Implementing action groups to execute complex workflows.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combining foundational models with external knowledge bases for enhanced context and responses.

### Features  

1. **Foundational Model Integrations**:  
   - Amazon Titan for text and embeddings.  
   - Nova for multimodal capabilities.  
   - Third-party models like Claude, Llama, and others available in Bedrock.  

2. **Use Cases and Samples**:  
   - Text summarization and classification.  
   - Multimodal applications like image and chart analysis.  
   - Workflow automation using Bedrock Agents.  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific applications.  

3. **End-to-End Projects**:  
   - Building intelligent chatbots.  
   - Automating customer support workflows.  
   - AI-driven content generation and optimization.

### Prerequisites  

1. **AWS Account**: Ensure Bedrock access is enabled for your account.  
2. **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the examples.  
3. **AWS SDK (Boto3)** and **Bedrock Client**: Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install boto3 amazon-bedrock
   ```
